Hello! My name is Luis Arzola. I’m a Mexican game developer who enjoys being in positions that involve facilitating and learning about the work of others.

Throughout the years I've been forced to wear many hats, from organizational to artistic, and while this hasn’t led me to being close to fully proficient on all areas,  I do think this combined background has made me quite flexible, a fast learner, and very understanding about how different disciplines work together.

I genuinely think that there is always a way to reduce the amount of tedious work, allowing one to just focus at the things they are best at instead, and wish to be entrusted with making that happen.

During my free time, you'll likely find me doing karate, playing games, or tinkering/breaking apart something to see how it works. If for some reason I'm doing more than one at the exact same moment, please detain me.
